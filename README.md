For the password generator challenge, I was given the CSS and HTML and used JavaScript to make a random password generate, to the desired length between 8 and 128. Also, the user has the option to include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and/or special characters.

I added comments in the JS file to outline the purpose of the statements.
